# My Portfolio

## Why Flutter?

For those unfamiliar, Flutter is a framework created by Google—it is primarily used to build mobile applications for iOS and android. Flutter recently introduced web support in early 2020, which allowed developers to create flutter web applications.

I was nearing the end of General Assembly's software engineering immersive program and experiencing some serious 'React Fatigue'. While browsing countless developer portfolios looking for inspiration, I noticed nearly all of them were built using React.

I wanted my portfolio to be simple in design—a one-pager—something people would not have to spend a lot of time browsing through. I thought something with a native app look and feel would be great for that particular use case.
